 ICE_HGO_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "When using HGO, we recommend that you play as Iceland. Iceland's lack of foreign cores, decent size, and isolated position make it ideal for transfering states to in order to release new nations.\n\nReleasing nations directly as the occupier or through the console may release the nation far larger than you'd like, and can create issues due to removing cores of occupiers. In addition, some countries are unable to release other nations due to game mechanics not used in HGO."
 OTHER_HGO_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "If you'd like to tag switch between occupiers and release nations that way, feel free to select this option to view the map and pick any country to start as."
